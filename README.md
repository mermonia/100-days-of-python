# 100 Days of Python

This repo contains my solutions and exercises for the [100 Days of Python Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

## Structure

- All daily projects are inside the `days/` folder.
- Each day folder is named `dayXXX`, e.g., `day001`, `day002`, etc.

## Day Index

Here’s a list of all the days with links to their folders:

<!-- DAY-INDEX-START -->
<!-- This section is auto-generated -->
<!-- DAY-INDEX-END -->

---

## How to use

- Navigate into a specific day folder to explore that day’s code.
- You can run `main.py` files inside each day folder to test exercises.
